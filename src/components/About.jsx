        Jazã and Sakeenah is a secured digital real estate asset trading and management platform that allows everyone irrespective of their location to buy and watch over their landed property online except for the site allocation that requires physical presence at specific times where landowner/representative will be required to show up or at any future time the landowner is available. 
        <br /><br /><br />
        Simply put, this web-app is where you can buy landed property online and also get your property documents shipped to you, get the land designed, built, managed and even secured it for landbanking as long as you want. 
        <br /><br /><br />
        These properties are managed and secured on behalf of the owners by professional trustees that are registered with their respective national bodies such as Estate Surveyors, Land Surveyors, Lawyers, Engineers etc
        <br /><br /><br />
        After purchase, the new landowner gets land documents; Survey Plan, Deed of Assignment and Governor's Consent delivered to him/her. 
        <br /><br /><br />
        And to cap it all, there's a great opportunity for those who want to also passively build their own real estate business to become a "Sell To Earn Team" where you get Free training on Property Title, Documentation and Practical Property Selling that can make you earn tangible weekly selling income using whatever land size purchased as a stepping stone.
        <br /><br /><br />
        So basically, the web-app platform allows you to buy your landed property, sell properties and also monitor the progress of your asset at any time from wherever you are located irrespective of your income level be it to buy Full-Owner lots, developer lots or mini-landbanking co-own lots.
